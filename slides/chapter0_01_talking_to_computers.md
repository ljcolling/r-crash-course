# Talking to computers

---

## Computers are dumb, humans are smart!

**Computers** and **humans** are a bit different. Humans are **smart** but computers are **dumb**!

There are lot of things that don't confuse humans but will easily confuse computers

Let's take a look at the sentence below:

```
My best friend is Courtney because COURTNEY has a dog.
```

In this sentence, I wrote the name of my friend – *Courtney* – twice. The first time I wrote it with a big letter at the start and then small letters. The second time I wrote it all in big letters.

You and I know that both **instances** of the word Courtney/COURTNEY refer to the same person—my friend Courtney

*But would a computer understand?*

### Spelling matters 

Computers are **dumb** because they can't figure out that Courtney and COURTNEY **mean the same person**
